    "\n",
    "Neural networks are a machine learning method inspired by how the human brain works. They are particularly good at pattern recognition and classification tasks, often using images as inputs. They are a well-established machine learning technique, having been around since the 1950s, but they've gone through several iterations to overcome limitations in previous generations. Using state-of-the-art neural networks is often referred to as 'deep learning'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptrons are the building blocks of neural networks. They are an artificial version of a single neuron in the brain. They typically have one or more inputs and a single output. Each input will be multiplied by a weight and the value of all the weighted inputs are then summed together. Finally, the summed value is put through an activation function which decides if the neuron \"fires\" a signal. In some cases, this activation function is simply a threshold step function which outputs zero below a certain input and one above it. Other designs of neurons use other activation functions, but typically they have an output between zero and one and are still step-like in their nature.\n",

    "### Coding a perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a perceptron written as a Python function. The function takes three parameters: `Inputs` is a list of input values, `Weights` is a list of weight values and `Threshold` is the activation threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we multiply each input by the corresponding weight. To do this quickly and concisely, we will use the numpy multiply function which can multiply each item in a list by a corresponding item in another list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then take the sum of all the inputs multiplied by their weights. Finally, if this value is less than the activation threshold, we output zero, otherwise we output a one."

Typically, networks are connected in layers with an input layer, middle or hidden layer (or layers), and finally an output layer.\n",

    "Multi-layer perceptrons need to be trained by showing them a set of training data and measuring the error between the network's predicted output and the true value. Training takes an iterative approach that improves the network a little each time a new training example is presented. There are a number of training algorithms available for a neural network today, but we are going to use one of the best established and well known, the backpropagation algorithm. This algorithm is called back propagation because it takes the error calculated between an output of the network and the true value and takes it back through the network to update the weights. If you want to read more about back propagation, please see [this chapter](http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rojas/neural/chapter/K7.pdf) from the book \"Neural Networks - A Systematic Introduction\".\n",

Each image is 28x28 pixels in size (784 pixels in total) and is represented in grayscale with values between zero for fully black and 255 for fully white. This means we will need 784 perceptrons in our input layer, each taking the input of one pixel and 10 perceptrons in our output layer to represent each digit we might classify. If trained correctly, only the perceptron in the output layer will \"fire\" to represent the contents of the image (but this is a massive oversimplification!).\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we need to initialise a neural network. Scikit-Learn has an entire library for this (`sklearn.neural_network`) and the `MLPClassifier` class handles multi-layer perceptrons. This network takes a few parameters including the size of the hidden layer, the maximum number of training iterations we're going to allow, the exact algorithm to use, whether or not we'd like verbose output about what the training is doing, and the initial state of the random number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn's `MLPClassifier`, the `hidden_layer_sizes` parameter specifies the number and size of hidden layers in the neural network. For example, `hidden_layer_sizes=(50,)` creates a single hidden layer with 50 neurons, while `(100, 50)` creates two hidden layers with 100 and 50 neurons, respectively. It’s important to include the trailing comma for a single hidden layer (e.g., `(50,)`) because without it, `(50)` would be interpreted as an integer, not a tuple, and cause an error. The example, `MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50,), max_iter=50, verbose=1, random_state=1)`, builds a neural network with one hidden layer containing 50 neurons, runs for a maximum of 50 iterations, logs training progress, and ensures reproducibility with `random_state=1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The max_iter parameter in MLPClassifier specifies the maximum number of iterations, not epochs. Since MLPClassifier uses stochastic gradient descent (or its variants), each iteration processes a small random subset of the data (a batch), and the full dataset may not be seen in a single iteration."

In this case, our input data is a 28x28 pixel image, which can also be represented as a 784-element list of data. The output will be a number between 0 and 9 telling us which digit the network thinks we have supplied. The `predict` function in the `MLPClassifier` class can be used to make a prediction. Lets use the first digit from our test set as an example.\n",

In order to present it to the predictor, we have to turn it into a numpy array which has the dimensions of 1x784 instead of 28x28. We can then call the `predict` function with this array as our parameter. This will return an array of predictions (as it could have been given multiple inputs), the first element of this will be the predicted digit. You may get a warning stating \"X does not have valid feature names\", this is because we didn't encode feature names into our X (digit images) data."

    "We now know what percentage of images were correctly classified, but we don't know anything about the distribution of correct predictions across our different classes (the digits 0 to 9 in this case). A more powerful technique is known as a confusion matrix. Here we draw a grid with each class along both the x and y axis. The x axis is the actual number of items in each class and the y axis is the predicted number. In a perfect classifier, there will be a diagonal line of values across the grid moving from the top left to bottom right corresponding to the number in each class, and all other cells will be zero. If any cell outside of the diagonal is non-zero then it indicates a miss-classification. Scikit-Learn has a function called `confusion_matrix` in the `sklearn.metrics` class which can display a confusion matrix for us. It will need two inputs: arrays showing how many items were in each class for both the real data and the classifications. We already have the real data in the labels_test array, but we need to build it for the classifications by classifying each image (in the same order as the real data) and storing the result in another array."
