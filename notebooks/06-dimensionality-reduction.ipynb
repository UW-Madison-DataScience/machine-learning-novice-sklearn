    "As seen in the last episode, general clustering algorithms work well with low-dimensional data. In this episode we see how higher-dimensional data, such as images of handwritten text or numbers, can be processed with dimensionality reduction techniques to make the datasets more accessible for other modelling techniques. The dataset we will be using is the Scikit-Learn subset of the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset.\n",

When dealing with a series of images in machine learning we consider each pixel to be a feature that varies according to each of the sample images. Our previous penguin dataset only had no more than 7 features to train with, however even a small 28x28 MNIST image has as much as 784 features (pixels) to work with.\n",

    "### t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n",
    "t-SNE is a powerful example of manifold learning - a non-deterministic non-linear approach to dimensionality reduction. A **manifold** is a way to think about complex, high-dimensional data as if it exists on a simpler, lower-dimensional shape within that space. Imagine a crumpled piece of paper: while it exists in 3D space when crumpled, the surface of the paper itself is inherently 2D. Similarly, in many datasets, the meaningful patterns and relationships lie along such \"lower-dimensional surfaces\" within the high-dimensional space. For example, in image data like MNIST, the raw pixels (hundreds of dimensions) may seem high-dimensional, but the actual structure (the shapes of digits) is much simpler, often following a lower-dimensional manifold. Manifold learning techniques like t-SNE aim to \"uncrumple\" the data and flatten it into a lower-dimensional space, while preserving the relationships between points as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition for t-SNE\n",
    "t-SNE (**t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding**) is a method for visualizing high-dimensional data by mapping it into a low-dimensional space, typically 2D or 3D, while emphasizing *local relationships*. It focuses on keeping nearby points close together, helping to reveal clusters or patterns that may be hidden in the original high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An analogy**: Imagine moving a group of friends from a large, crowded park into a much smaller garden while trying to keep people who are chatting with each other close. You won’t care much about preserving the exact distances between groups from the original park—your main goal is to keep friends near each other in the smaller space. Similarly, t-SNE prioritizes preserving these *local connections*, while global distances between clusters may be distorted or not reflect their true relationships. This distortion happens because t-SNE sacrifices global structure to accurately capture local neighborhoods. For example:\n",
    "- Two clusters that appear far apart in the t-SNE plot may actually be closer in the original high-dimensional space.\n",
    "- Similarly, clusters that appear close together in the plot might not actually be neighbors in the original space.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, while t-SNE is excellent for discovering *local patterns* (e.g., clusters, subgroups), you should be cautious about interpreting the relative distances between clusters. These are less reliable and are influenced by how the algorithm optimizes its layout in the reduced space. It's best to use t-SNE as a tool to find grouping and then validate these findings using additional analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more in depth explanations of t-SNE and manifold learning please see the following links which also contain som very nice visual examples of manifold learning in action:\n",
