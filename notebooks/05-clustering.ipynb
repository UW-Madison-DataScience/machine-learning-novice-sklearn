    "\n",
    "In episode 2 we learnt about supervised learning. Now it is time to explore unsupervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we do not have the luxury of using labelled data. This could be for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have labelled data, but not enough to accurately train our model\n",
    "* Our existing labelled data is low-quality or innacurate\n",
    "* It is too time-consuming to (manually) label more data\n",
    "* We have data, but no idea what correlations might exist that we could model!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we need to use unsupervised learning. As the name suggests, this time we do not \"supervise\" the ML algorithm by providing it labels, but instead we let it try to find its own patterns in the data and report back on any correlations that it might find. You can think of unsupervised learning as a way to discover labels from the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is the grouping of data points which are similar to each other. It can be a powerful technique for identifying patterns in data.\n",
    "Clustering analysis does not usually require any training and is therefore known as an unsupervised learning technique. Clustering can be applied quickly due to this lack of training.\n",

    "## Applications of clustering\n",

    "## K-means clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-means clustering algorithm is a simple clustering algorithm that tries to identify the centre of each cluster.\n",
    "It does this by searching for a point which minimises the distance between the centre and all the points in the cluster.\n",
    "The algorithm needs to be told how many k clusters to look for, but a common technique is to try different numbers of clusters and combine\n",
