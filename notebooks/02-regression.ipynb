    "# Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical machine learning is often divided into two categories – supervised and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of supervised learning we act as a \"supervisor\" or \"teacher\" for our ML algorithms by providing the algorithm with \"labelled data\" that contains example answers of what we wish the algorithm to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we wish to train our algorithm to distinguish between images of cats and dogs, we would provide our algorithm with images that have already been labelled as \"cat\" or \"dog\" so that it can learn from these examples. If we wished to train our algorithm to predict house prices over time we would provide our algorithm with example data of datetime values that are \"labelled\" with house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is split up into two further categories: classification and regression. For classification the labelled data is discrete, such as the \"cat\" or \"dog\" example, whereas for regression the labelled data is continuous, such as the house price example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this episode we will explore how we can use regression to build a \"model\" that can be used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable (a label or target variable in ML terms) to one or more independent variables (features in ML terms). A regression model attempts to describe this relation by fitting the data as closely as possible according to mathematical criteria. This model can then be used to predict new labelled values by inputting the independent variables into it. For example, if we create a house price model we can then feed in any datetime value we wish, and get a new house price value prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression can be as simple as drawing a \"line of best fit\" through data points, known as linear regression, or more complex models such as polynomial regression, and is used routinely around the world in both industry and research. You may have already used regression in the past without knowing that it is also considered a machine learning technique!\n",

To do this, we apply dummy coding (also called one-hot encoding), which creates new binary columns for each species category (e.g., species_Adelie, species_Chinstrap, species_Gentoo). Each row gets a 1 in the column that matches its species and 0 in the others.\n",
