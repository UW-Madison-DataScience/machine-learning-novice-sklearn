    "\n",
    "What's better than one decision tree? Perhaps two? or three? How about enough trees to make up a forest? \n",
    "Ensemble methods bundle individual models together and use each of their outputs to contribute towards a final consensus for a given problem. Ensemble methods are based on the mantra that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking back to the classification episode with decision trees we quickly stumbled into the problem of overfitting our training data. If we combine predictions from a series of over/under fitting estimators then we can often produce a better final prediction than using a single reliable model - in the same way that humans often hear multiple opinions on a scenario before deciding a final outcome. Decision trees and regressions are often very sensitive to training outliers and so are well suited to be a part of an ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods are used for a variety of applciations including, but not limited to, search systems and object detection. We can use any model/estimator available in sci-kit learn to create an ensemble. There are three main methods to create ensembles approaches: \n",

    "\n",
    "### Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we train a series of different models/estimators on the same input data in parallel. We then take the output of each model and pass them into a final decision algorithm/model that makes the final prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we trained the same model multiple times on the same data we would expect very similar answers, and so the emphasis with stacking is to choose different models that can be used to build up a reliable concensus. Regression is then typically a good choice for the final decision-making model.\n",

    "### Bagging (a.k.a [Bootstrap AGGregatING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating) )\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we use the same model/estimator and fit it on different subsets of the training data. We can then average the results from each model to produce a final prediction. The subsets are random and may even repeat themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to remember**: The name comes from combining two ideas, bootstrap (random sampling with replacement) and aggregating (combining predictions). Imagine putting your data into a \"bag,\" pulling out random samples (with replacement), training models on those samples, and combining their outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common example is known as the Random Forest algorithm, which we'll take a look at later on. Random Forests are typically used as a faster, computationally cheaper alternative to Neural Networks, which is ideal for real-time applications like camera face detection prompts.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is where we train a single type of Model/estimator on an initial dataset, test it's accuracy, and then subsequently train the same type of models on poorly predicted samples i.e. each new model pays most attention to data that were incorrectly predicted by the last one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like for bagging, boosting is trained mostly on subsets, however in this case these subsets are not randomly generated but are instead built using poorly estimated predictions. Boosting can produce some very high accuracies by learning from it's mistakes, but due to the iterative nature of these improvements it doesn't parallelize well unlike the other ensemble methods. Despite this it can still be a faster, and computationally cheaper alternative to Neural Networks.\n",

    "Each of our models score between 0.61-0.82, which at the high end is good, but at the low end is a pretty poor prediction accuracy score. Do note that the toy datasets are not representative of real world data. However what we can see is that the stacked result generated by the voting regressor fits different sub-models and then averages the individual predictions to form a final prediction. The benefit of this approach is that, it reduces overfitting and increases generalizability. Of course, we could try and improve our accuracy score by tweaking with our indivdual model hyperparameters, using more advaced boosted models or adjusting our training data features and train-test-split data.\n",
